# Singapore_Resale_Flat_Trend

I am interested to find out the trend of HDB resale flats and to observe for any relationship or factors affecting the price and sales of resale flats.

Housing had always been an essential item to all consumers, by observing the trend we can observe what factors are affecting the price of the flats in Singapore which will aid in buyer decision making. For buyers, value of the flat is the major concern as most buyers will be staying for years before making another move hence buyers would one flats that are low risk in depreciation and worthy. For this observation i will be viewing via buyer perspective to find out the trend.

# Below are the few main questions:

1) What floor range should buyer purchase? 
2) What town should buyer Purchase a flat from? 
3) Which size should buyers look at? 
4) What duration left of flat lease is better to purchase? 
5) When should buyer purchase?
